This is a recently started, personal project to explore and develop my skills in RoR full stack development. 
The idea is that this site will be for a local town/village to enable them to see events, local shops (with video tours), make community donations via Stripe etc.
It is also a work in progress and so as a result, no pull requests will be accepted here ðŸ˜„.
It should be noted that the idea for this project is not to demonstrate any front-end skills...
